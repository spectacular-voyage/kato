# User_2026-02-27_2150_00

template filename can be kato-config.template.yaml

Yes, if no argument is provided for export, the same filename generator and defaultOutputPath should be used.

One more feature idea: if the output argument is just a directory path, use that instead of defaultOutputPath, but still use the filename generator.

**Preparing concise note patch**

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-27_2150_05

I’m folding those decisions into the task note now: lock the template filename, apply the same generated-path behavior to pathless `export`, and add the “directory argument means generate filename in that directory” rule.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-27_2150_08

I’m patching the existing sections directly so the note stays internally consistent rather than appending extra bullets.

**Checking list numbering consistency**

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-27_2150_38

I’m checking the note once to catch any awkward wording or numbering drift from the patch.

**Clarifying directory output behavior**
**Refining export command behavior**

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-27_2150_54

There’s one small cleanup: the goal list has a duplicated `4`, and I’m also tightening the directory-argument rule so it explicitly covers CLI `kato export --output <dir>` rather than leaving that as an open question.

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-27_2151_03

I’ve cleaned that up. I’m doing a quick readback of the edited sections to confirm the list and the CLI export rule are now aligned.

**Noting timestamp update nuance**

# gpt-5.3-codex_2026-02-27_2151_12

I updated [task.2026.2026-02-27-per-workspace-daemons.md](/home/djradon/hub/spectacular-voyage/kato/dev-docs/notes/task.2026.2026-02-27-per-workspace-daemons.md) with those decisions.

It now explicitly locks:
- the template path as `~/.kato/kato-config.template.yaml`
- pathless `export` using the same `filenameTemplate` + `defaultOutputPath` generator
- directory-path arguments as “override the base directory, still generate the filename”
- the same directory rule for CLI `kato export <id> --output <dir>`

I also removed the now-obsolete open question about CLI export directory behavior and cleaned up the numbering in the goal list.

No tests were run since this was a doc-only edit.

1. If you want, I can make one more pass on the note to lock the non-existent-directory rule (for example: existing dir only vs trailing slash also counts as dir).
2. If you want to start implementation, the next sensible step is updating the config contract and runtime config loader.
