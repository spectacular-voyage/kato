- good frontmatter generation
- thinking and tools use should use, as default, the settings in config (defaults/general/workspace) but allow per-session overrids, maybe by adding flags to the "::" commands
- scan recent folders more recently, scan older folders (much) less frequency
- add scanning for .codex/.claude folders even if not initially present
- support for kimi, etc
- add an "interlocutors" YAML field, and maybe sessionId field as well. 
- create a summary file (and/or decision log, maybe update a to-do file) on command
  - dangerous because AI/network
- "::seal" command : sign, hash, and close a file
  - tricky, because we can't write the hash into the file?
- web-based UI for status; surfacing history and logs; surfacing in-chat commands; tracking performance
- run-as-service on Windows; systemd/init.d on Linux; launchd on macOS
- switch config to YAML
- Multi-destination recording
- support flag in in-chat comments, e.g. to start including thinking or tool use
