- scan recent folders more recently, scan older folders (much) less frequency
- add scanning for .codex/.claude folders even if not initially present
- support restart and reload CLI commands
- handle recording of "choices" options and chosen option
- support for gemini, kimi, etc
- add an "interlocutors" YAML field, and maybe a sessionId filed as well. 
- create a summary file (and/or decision log, maybe update a to-do file) on command
- overhaul status
- switch to deno and multi-agent structure with each agent monitoring a single source, and outputing to only allowed destinations
- "::seal" command : sign, hash, and close a file
- web-based UI for status; cleaning sessions, surfacing history and logs
- run-as-service on windows; systemd/init.d on linux; and whatever macos uses
